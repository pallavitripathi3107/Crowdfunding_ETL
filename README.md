## Project Description
In this ETL mini project, we work together to build ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming data, we uploaded the data into 5 CSV files and created an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we have uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
